# COSMOS SEARCH

## 🌎 Introduction

First of all, understand this: **this project was not made for the world**. It’s not a global solution. It’s a study. I welcome criticism, but know that **I built this for myself**. I wanted a homepage with **no tracking, no ads, and no unnecessary clutter**. If you’re expecting something "complete," "polished," or "professional," this isn’t the place for you. At least not in this project.

If you want to use, modify, or destroy it, go ahead. The code is available—**no support, no promises, no obligations**. If it works for you, great. If not, move on.

## 🔍 What is Cosmos Search?

A homepage. But not just any homepage. **It’s my homepage.** No other homepage satisfied me. There was always something missing or too much unnecessary junk. Here, there are no "relevant news" or "personalized recommendations" trying to sell your soul.

If you like being treated as **marketing cattle**, this isn’t for you. If you prefer something **straightforward and functional**, you’re in the right place.

### ✨ Features:
- **Integrated search with Google** (no option to change it for now).
- **4 visual themes** (so you don’t get bored looking at the same interface all the time).
- **Customizable favorites.** To add or modify, edit the config file directly.
- **Control over visual effects** (blur and transparency—"I use KDE").
- **Support for custom wallpapers** (upload and choose whatever you want to see).

If you think this sucks, **don’t use it**. I made it for myself. Simple as that.

## 🛠️ Why did I make this?

Because **I wanted to. Because I could. Because I love coding. Because existing options suck.**

Homepages are filled with ads and trackers. I don’t want to be part of that. Maybe in the future, I’ll sell your data to a big tech company, but **not yet**. :)

This is a personal project—to **learn and step out of my comfort zone.** Not to save the world.

## 🚀 How to run (if you want to try)

### **Easy mode:**
1. Download the files.
2. Open in VSCode with Live Server.
3. Done. Enjoy.

### **"Serious developer" mode:**

cd cosmos-search
npx serve
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

- **React Hooks** (no boring class components here).
- **LocalStorage** to save preferences without needing a server.
- **Modern CSS** (variables, backdrop-filter, responsive layout).
- **Dynamic SVG for icons** (because PNG is outdated).
- I tried to **polish the code**, but **I’m not a professional**—it’s still rough, but I did my best.
- There are orphaned parts because **it’s still in development**.

## ⚠️ Limitations

- **No cross-device sync**. Contributions are welcome. :D
- **Zero compatibility with old browsers.**
- **It might break.** I work on this when I have time.
- **Documentation?** Hahaha! If you need it, maybe you shouldn’t be messing with this.

## 🛠️ Future Plans

- More **themes and visual customization** without editing the code.
- Maybe a **browser extension version** (if I have the patience).
- Or maybe I’ll **abandon this and do something else**. That’s life.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

My name is **Esthevan**, I’m **17**, and I study **Computer Science at Unicruz - Cruz Alta/Brazil**. I skipped a year in school and got into college early. Since I was a kid, **technology has fascinated me**. I learned to read at 4, started coding at 9.

- **Started with Lua**, modding games.
- Moved to **Python, JavaScript, C, and a bit of Java**.
- **Not an experienced programmer**, but I know the basics of almost everything.
- **First real project?** 2022. A school assignment that turned into a Python + KivyMD recycling collection software. It was implemented in my city, and we got recognition (two certificates and a medal).
- Built an **emergency response platform** (paused due to lack of time).
- Developed the **frontend for an NGO** in Rio Grande do Sul.
- Currently working on **three college projects, all from scratch**.
- Organizing an **open-source group** to build real solutions with some classmates.

By the way, **proprietary software isn’t a problem for me**. The problem is **monopolies that stifle innovation**.

If you expect **support or frequent updates**, forget it. **The code is here. Use it if you want.**

## 📩 Want to contact me?

**Discord:** `hoop0007` _(If you ask for support, I’ll laugh. I warned you.)_

## 🎯 Who is this for?

- People who **like exploring code and personal projects**.
- People who **understand this is not a commercial product**.
- People who **think default homepages are garbage**.
- People who **prefer modifying their tools instead of accepting ready-made solutions**.

If you don’t fit into any of these, **that’s your problem**. I’ll keep tweaking this when I have time.
